# Guess the Number Game

A simple, interactive browser-based game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback ("Too High" or "Too Low") to guide the player, and displays a congratulatory message or a "Game Over" popup based on the outcome.

## Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- Dynamic feedback for player guesses.
- Limited attempts to guess the correct number (default: 5 attempts).
- Popup messages for game completion (win or loss).
- Responsive and user-friendly design.

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Enter your guess (a number between 1 and 100) in the input box.
3. Click "Submit Guess."
4. Read the feedback:
   - If your guess is too high, try a lower number.
   - If your guess is too low, try a higher number.
5. Continue guessing until:
   - You guess the correct number, or
   - You run out of attempts.
6. A popup will show your result (win or loss). Click "Play Again" to restart.
